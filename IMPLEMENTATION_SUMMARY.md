# GitHub Actions CI/CD Implementation Summary

## Overview

This PR implements a complete CI/CD workflow for the chess-variants-display project that automatically runs tests on pull requests and prevents merging when tests fail.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/test.yml`)

A workflow that:
- **Triggers on:**
  - Pull request events: `opened`, `synchronize`, `reopened`, `ready_for_review`
  - Pushes to the `main` branch
  
- **Smart Draft Detection:**
  - Skips execution when PR is in draft mode using condition: 
    ```yaml
    if: github.event_name == 'push' || github.event.pull_request.draft == false
    ```
  - This prevents wasting CI minutes while Copilot (or developers) are still working on changes
  - Runs automatically once PR is marked as "Ready for review"

- **Test Execution Steps:**
  1. Checks out code
  2. Sets up Java 11 (Temurin distribution)
  3. Installs Clojure CLI tools
  4. Caches Maven and Gitlibs dependencies for faster runs
  5. Runs the test suite: `clojure -M:test -e "(require 'chess-variants-display.core-test) (clojure.test/run-tests 'chess-variants-display.core-test)"`

### 2. Documentation Updates

- **README.md**: Added "Continuous Integration" section explaining:
  - How the workflow operates
  - When it runs (and when it doesn't)
  - Instructions for making it a required check

- **BRANCH_PROTECTION.md**: Comprehensive guide for setting up branch protection, including:
  - Step-by-step instructions for configuring GitHub branch protection rules
  - How to make the test workflow a required status check
  - Troubleshooting tips
  - Best practices for branch protection

### 3. Configuration Updates

- **.gitignore**: Added entry for temporary install scripts to keep the repo clean

## How to Use

### For Repository Admins

1. **Set up branch protection** (required to prevent merging on test failures):
   - Follow instructions in `BRANCH_PROTECTION.md`
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Add branch protection rule for `main`
   - Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"
   - Select "test" as a required check

### For Contributors

1. **Create a PR:**
   - The workflow will automatically run when you create a PR
   - If you create a draft PR, tests won't run until you mark it as "Ready for review"

2. **Monitor test results:**
   - Check the "Checks" tab on your PR
   - Tests must pass before merging
   - If tests fail, you'll see the error details in the workflow logs

3. **For Copilot PRs:**
   - Copilot typically starts PRs in draft mode
   - Tests won't run until the PR is ready for review
   - This saves CI minutes and reduces noise

## Validation

The workflow has been:
- ‚úÖ YAML syntax validated with `yamllint`
- ‚úÖ Tested locally to ensure tests run successfully
- ‚úÖ Configured with proper caching for efficient CI runs
- ‚úÖ Documented for easy setup and maintenance

## Files Changed

- `.github/workflows/test.yml` - Main CI workflow
- `README.md` - Added CI/CD documentation
- `BRANCH_PROTECTION.md` - Detailed setup instructions
- `.gitignore` - Added temporary files exclusion

## Next Steps

1. **Merge this PR** to enable the workflow
2. **Set up branch protection** following `BRANCH_PROTECTION.md`
3. **Test the workflow** by creating a test PR
4. **Verify** that the "test" check appears as required

## Benefits

- üõ°Ô∏è **Protection**: Prevents broken code from reaching main branch
- ‚ö° **Efficiency**: Smart draft detection saves CI minutes
- üìä **Visibility**: Clear test status on all PRs
- üîÑ **Automation**: No manual test running needed
- üéØ **Copilot-friendly**: Works seamlessly with GitHub Copilot Workspace
